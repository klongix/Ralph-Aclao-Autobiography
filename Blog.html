    Things About Me
</h1>

<p class="hvvy1">
    I am a music lover, as well as an instrument player. I can play bass, as well as some basic drums. 
    However, the instrument I spend most of my time playing is the guitar. I first learned to play guitar in 
    9th grade of junior high-school; my origin story as cliché as that of the next guitar player; learning guitar 
    to impress a girl. Yes, I started learning guitar to impress my then crush, now my girlfriend for five years. 
    As time went by, I learned to love guitar and I also ended up playing for my home church’s worship team.

    I joined my first oratorical contest in 8th grade of junior high school. Although it was neither my first exposure to public speaking, nor was it my first public speaking contest, it was the first of the three-year streak that was to come in my junior high school years. The theme for the contest for that time was about poverty. I was chosen by my coach, possibly through my classmate’s recommendation. Of course, I still had to prove myself, and that’s how I got the spot. On the day of my first regional level oratorical contest, I managed to get 2nd place.

    For the next three years of junior high school, I would then represent my alma-mater Misamis Oriental General 
    Comprehensive High School in oratorical contests and one extemporaneous speech contest. Winning 1st place in the RDRRMC 
    oratorical speech contest, and 2nd place in the BALAOD Mindanao extemporaneous speech contest. Of the other contests, 
    finished in 2nd place. <br>
    After junior-high school it was senior-high school where it was mostly quiet, but nonetheless allowed me to experience 
    new things mostly on the academic side.

        FAMILY
        <br>
        Aside from those other things, I am very thankful for the family that I have. We are by no means a perfect family however,
        we do care about each other nonetheless. I am particularly thankful for my parents and also my girlfriend, who have supported me, and
        didn't give up on me even when I almost gave up on myself. The past few years have been very rough on my life, and without
        a shadow of a doubt I can attest I am still climbing up from the bottom-most point of my life, scarred from the mental
        pressure and depression I have experienced. Recovering from such disaster is difficult as it requires me to change myself;
        ridding me of all the habits that put me at risk of falling back again. However, for the two years I have stopped studying,
        I realized it is much better to struggle for noble and important things, than to writhe in the pain of losing yourself
        to the depression. <br><Br>

        I am grateful for the lives of my family, my girlfriend, friends and others who reached out to me during my difficult time.
        It brought life, no matter how little to the walking dead man that I was. After all, it was through the little
        acts of kindness where I found the bigger reasons to continue.
